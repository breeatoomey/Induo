Project Proposal Feedback
Project: induo
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
VERY complete proposal document!  One of the best I've seen for the way
you give the problem statement as well as your solution.  Having the key
features in a bullet list cuts down on the text reading for that section
but don't be afraid of puttong SOME text in ~ having nothing but lists
like this can make the reader feel like they are not getting the full
explanation.

Your justification section is great!

Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
Presentation slides missing from repository.
Dang it....

Summary:
--------
Total:  2% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Nice job overall on the document.

Keep up the good work!
